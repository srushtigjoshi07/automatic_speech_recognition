# 🎙️ ASR-Powered Video Subtitle Generator

An end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system that automatically generates subtitles from videos and embeds them back into the video.

This project extracts audio from a video, transcribes speech using Facebook's Wav2Vec2 model, generates timestamped subtitles in SRT format, and burns the subtitles directly onto the video using OpenCV and MoviePy.

## 🧠 Model Used

### Facebook Wav2Vec2 Base 960H

A pretrained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model developed by Meta AI.

```python
facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h
```

The model converts raw speech waveforms directly into text and is trained on 960 hours of English speech data.
